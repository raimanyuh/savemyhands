# savemyhands — Project Brief

## What This App Does
savemyhands is a live poker hand history recorder and replayer.
Users record hands they played live (in-person) using a visual
GUI, then share them via unique URLs so anyone can watch the
hand play out like an online hand history.

## Core Features

### 1. Hand Recording GUI
- Visual poker table interface (not text input)
- User can add players, assign seat positions, names, stack sizes
- Input hole cards using a card picker UI (like PokerNow's big
  card buttons)
- Record street-by-street actions: fold, check, call, raise,
  bet with amounts
- Support for preflop, flop, turn, river
- Record board cards for each street

### 2. Hand Replayer
- Replay recorded hands like an online poker hand history
- Animated, step-by-step playback on a visual poker table
- Show actions, pot size, stack sizes updating in real time
- Public-facing — no login required to view a shared hand

### 3. Unique Share URLs
- Every saved hand gets a unique URL (e.g. savemyhands.vercel.app/hand/abc123)
- Shareable on social media
- Anyone can view without an account

### 4. User Hand Database
- Each logged-in user sees all their recorded hands
- Filter by: date, location, game type
- Filter by hand type: SRP (single raised pot), 3BP (3-bet pot),
  4BP (4-bet pot)
- Eventually: win/loss tracking, notes per hand

## Design Direction
- Visual style: mix of GTOWizard (clean, dark, professional)
  and PokerNow (big card UI, easy to use)
- Dark theme
- Big, tactile card and action buttons for the recording GUI
- Clean minimal replayer

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Database Tables (to be created in Supabase)
- `users` — handled by Supabase Auth
- `hands` — one row per recorded hand
- `hand_players` — players in each hand (seat, name, stack)
- `hand_actions` — action-by-action log per hand
- `hand_streets` — board cards per street

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript throughout
- Use Supabase client for all database operations
- Use Shadcn components for all UI elements where possible
- Keep components small and reusable
- Pages go in /app directory following Next.js App Router conventions

## Build Priority Order
1. Auth (login/signup via Supabase)
2. Hand recording GUI
3. Hand save + unique URL generation
4. Hand replayer
5. User hand database/dashboard
6. Filtering
